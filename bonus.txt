 If Emeril was not in a rush to have this project completed (he doesn't need it till next weekend),
 I would begin to implement features that would further assist him at the food festival. The first 
 feature I would implement would be the ability to have multiple orders. I would follow this by 
 displaying how much time has past since the order was taken (the customers are eager to try Emeril's
 latest creation).

 If Emeril was planning to continue to use the application after the festival, I would like
 to implement a bar graph showing which were his most popular items (using highcharts). From this
 data he would know his most popular dishes and could better for the next event.
