 If Emril was not in a rush to have this project comleted (he doesn't need it till next weekend).
 I would begin implement features that would further assist him at the food festival. The first 
 feature I would implement would be the ability to have multiple orders. I would follow this by 
 displaying how much time has past since the order was taken (in food service it is important to 
 get orders out quick).

 If Emril was planning to continue to use the application after the festival, I would like
 to implement a bar graph showing which were his most popular items (using highcharts). From this
 data he could better prepare and set up for the next event.
